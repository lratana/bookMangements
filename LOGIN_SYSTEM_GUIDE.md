Content-Type: application/json

{
  "user_name": "admin",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

#### Register User
```bash
POST http://localhost:8080/api/users/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "user_name": "testuser",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "role": "user"
}
```

### 🧪 Testing Instructions:

1. **Access the Application**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend: http://localhost:8080

2. **Create Test Users**:
   ```bash
   # Create Admin User
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/users/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "user_name": "admin",
       "email": "admin@library.com", 
       "password": "admin123",
       "role": "admin"
     }'

   # Create Regular User
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/users/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "user_name": "john_doe",
       "email": "john@example.com",
       "password": "user123",
       "role": "user" 
     }'
   ```

3. **Test Login Flow**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000 (should redirect to /login)
   - Try registering a new account
   - Try logging in with created credentials
   - Verify dashboard access after login
   - Test logout functionality

4. **Test Role-Based Access**:
   - Login as admin → Should see Users and Librarians menu
   - Login as regular user → Should NOT see Users and Librarians menu
